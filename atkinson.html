                <p>Atkinson Landscaping was a booming business with a weak visual identity. Run by two young entrepreneurs with a passion for excellent customer experience, the brand didnâ€™t reflect the vision or personality of the company. Landscaping companies can be untrustworthy and under-qualified, and so the owners approached me for a brand-new bold and recognizable logo supported by professional-grade brand deliverables.</p>

                <h4>the old</h4>
                <p>I actually had previously designed a logo for Atkinson Landcaping when they first started up, but made two critical errors in that design: first, in an effort to go retro, I used a script font as the focal point. Because of the looping script, the logo could be read as &quot;Allison Landscaping&quot;. Second, the secondary font that I chose was too light of a weight, making it practically invisible. Both of these decisions eventually caused the owners to go to a different designer and use a different logo.</p>
                <p>The second time they asked me to work with them, I was not going to make those mistakes again.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-chunk-text">
                <h4>the new</h4>
                <p>Starting with a clean and legible font, I wanted to create a logo that had distinct features which could be seen and identified from a distance--especially from a car passing by a company truck or yard sign. The green-blue analogous colour scheme is memorable, and can be associated with an Earth-sky relationship. Through hours of pixel-by-pixel feedback, the completed logo was as much a labour of love for the owners as it was for me.</p>

            <div class="content-chunk-text content-quote">
                <h3>&quot;Rebecca helped us to create a great logo and brand that is now highly recognized in the community.&quot;</h3>

            <div class="content-chunk-text">
                <h4>now we here</h4>
                <p>Designing business cards, car magnets, and t-shirts for Atkinson Landscaping has generated a lot of brand recognition in the community since we started the rebrand two years ago. The new identity has shifted the owners&apos; focus from just running a functioning company, to casting a larger company vision of being the best, most respected landscaping company in the Lower Mainland. The company found new life and a new swagger.</p>
