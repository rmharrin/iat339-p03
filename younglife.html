                <p>With a vision to standardize and modernize the visual identity of Young Life in British Columbia, I was asked to update and create resources for Area Directors and for the Director of the Coastal Region. Many of the decisions regarding colour and type were made based on the existing brand standards guide for Young Life in the United States in order to create further recognizability and consistency across the overarching brand of Young Life.</p> 

                <p>The regional org chart was in need of an update, and not just in terms of the personnel. The original chart was disorganized, confusing, and (ironically) had no visual hierarchy. The first iterations of the org chart struggled with column width and meaningful alignment of the appropraite people within the same column. I experimented with landscape and portrait orientations, bottom-up and top-down flows, and different arrangements of personnel. Even though the final iteration actually added personnel and ministries, effective use of columns, colour, and bold text help guide the eye and make the org chart substantially less overwhelming.</p>

                <p>As a non-profit organization, Young Life is funded by donors. Young Life staff members send out newsletters to their donors either monthly or semi-monthly; these are critical points of contact for donors to feel involved in the organization, and to keep Young Life front-of-mind. However, across the Coastal Region, Area Directors are on their own to write and design their newsletters. I was asked to create a “Must-Haves” resource for Area Directors, giving them digestible but effective instructions about how to best format and utilize the newsletter platform. I targeted the document format and writing style towards the adult staff members with varying levels of technological knowledge.</p>

                <p>Over the course of a few months, my work became the standard of the visual identity of the Coastal Region. With a friendly voice and colour scheme, and cleaner presentation, Young Life Coastal presents as an approachable and current organization.</p>
