Atkinson Mowing & Yard Works was a booming business with a weak visual identity. Run by two young entrepreneurs with a passion for excellent customer experience, the brand didn’t reflect the vision of the company. After undergoing a name change to Atkinson Landscaping, the owners approached me for a new, bold and recognizable logo supported by professional-grade brand deliverables.

Starting with a clean and readable font, I wanted to create a logo that had distinct features which could be seen and identified from a distance, especially from a car passing by a company truck or yard sign. Uncomplicated sans-serif fonts allow for readability from all distances, and the monochromatic colour scheme is recognizable as an Earth-sky relationship. The circular graphic is able to be easily translated to an icon for social media use.

Landscaping companies can be untrustworthy and under-qualified, and so the main objective for the physical deliverables was to make a professional impression on customers. Through the number of iterations of business cards, the name of the cardholder has been the largest and most focal element, creating a sense of trust and a personal relationship.

Car magnets need to be legible and readable from a car window. Crowding the magnets with lots of information or graphic distractions would result in confusion with no informational value, and so we kept the door magnets simple with minimal information. For tailgate magnets, we were able to add details for vehicles following behind or stopped at a red light.

Overall, Atkinson Landscaping has been transformed from outdated and unclear to bright and bold, representative of the people and the values of the company.

With a vision to standardize and modernize the visual identity of Young Life in British Columbia, I was asked to update and create resources for Area Directors and for the Regional Director. Many of the decisions regarding colour and type were made based on the existing brand standards guide for Young Life in the United States in order to create further recognizability and consistency across the overarching brand of Young Life. 

Targeted towards young adults who are current volunteer Young Life leaders, these digital flyers were designed to recruit new staff. A call for young people to join a national movement is at the forefront, paired with a similarly charged subtitle. Originally I’d used a different photo with more interesting colours, but it lacked emotional value and visual interest. I replaced it with one with only faces and with an emotional connection to the mission of Young Life, to share “life to the full” with teenagers.

The regional org chart was in need of an update, and not just in terms of the personnel. The original chart was disorganized, confusing, and (ironically) had no visual hierarchy. Even though we added personnel and ministries, the use of columns and bold text help guide the eye and make the org chart less overwhelming.

This resource was used simply to augment previous training for Young Life’s Committees. These Committees consist of a group of adults who meet monthly to support their local Young Life ministry. There are various roles on the Committee which should be filled in order to have a well-functioning and strong support system for Young Life areas. “Getting the right people on the bus” is a critical part of building a Committee. 

The old bus diagram was overloaded with information with no visual hierarchy. Since the Committees have access to job descriptions and training regarding the individual roles, we were able to remove the overwhelming amount of text. I was then able to create a simplified version of the existing diagram which will be used as a reinforcement for the training Committee receive.

As a non-profit organization, Young Life is funded by donors. Young Life staff members send out newsletters to their donors either monthly or semi-monthly. These are critical points of contact for donors to feel involved in the organization, to know what their money is paying for, and to keep Young Life front-of-mind. Across the Coastal Region, Area Directors are on their own to write and design their newsletters. I was asked to create a “Must-Haves” resource to produce excellence and consistency, and for Young Life’s newsletters to be as advanced as newsletters can be. In addition, I redesigned the banners that the Coastal Region would use, as well as the Regional Director’s donor e-mail templates.

The three must-haves were based on research and my own knowledge of attention. I targeted the document format and writing style towards the adult staff members with varying levels of technological knowledge. Although relatively rudimentary in nature, the three must-haves will standardize the quality of newsletters arriving in the inboxes of donors.

Over the course of a few months, my work became the standard of the visual identity of the Coastal Region. With a friendly voice and colour scheme, and cleaner presentation, Young Life Coastal presents as an approachable and current organization.
