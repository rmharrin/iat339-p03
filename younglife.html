                    <p><em>With a vision to standardize and modernize the visual identity of Young Life in British Columbia</em>, I was asked to update and create resources for Area Directors and for the Director of the Coastal Region. Many of the decisions regarding colour and type were made based on the existing brand standards guide for Young Life in the United States in order to create further recognizability and consistency across the overarching brand of Young Life.</p>

                            <p>The regional org chart was in need of an update, and not just in terms of the personnel. The original chart was disorganized, confusing, and (ironically) had no visual hierarchy. The first iterations of the org chart struggled with column width and meaningful alignment of the appropriate people within the same column. I experimented with landscape and portrait orientations, bottom-up and top-down flows, and different arrangements of personnel. Even though the final iteration actually added personnel and ministries, effective use of columns, colour, and bold text help guide the eye and make the org chart substantially less overwhelming.</p>

                        <h4>cleaning up the bus</h4>
                        <p>This resource was used simply to augment previous training for Young Life’s Committees. These Committees consist of a group of adults who meet monthly to support their local Young Life ministry. There are various roles on the Committee which should be filled in order to have a well-functioning and strong support system for Young Life areas. “Getting the right people on the bus” is a critical part of building a Committee.</p>
                        <p>The old bus diagram was overloaded with information with no visual hierarchy. Since the Committees have access to job descriptions and training regarding the individual roles, we were able to remove the overwhelming amount of text. I was then able to create a simplified version of the existing diagram which will be used as a reinforcement for the training Committee receive.</p>
