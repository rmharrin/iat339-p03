You could say I've been a typographer from the beginning.

With laser focus and as much fine motor skill as I could muster, six-year-old me loved learning how to print. Worksheet after workshet, I carefully traced each letter of the alphabet and tried to re-create them with absolute perfection.

From tracing those letters to Kid Pix to WordArt to Illustrator, I've been obsessed with type and space for much of my life.

I am a visual and communication designer who engages in dialogue and brings dreams into reality. Through laughter, humility, and a little bit of freestyle on-the-spot Broadway-style singing, I cultivate collaboration and build relationships.
